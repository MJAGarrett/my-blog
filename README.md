# A Practice blog
This is a personal training project created following along with the "React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site" course by Shaun Wassel on LinkedIn (link to the
course in the "Inspiration" section). Its a simple blog with the lorem ipsum provided by the course.

## Technologies
### Front-End
- React v18.2.0
- Whatwg-fetch v3.6.2 (for compatibility with Internet Explorer)

### Back-End
- Node.js v16.15.1
- Express v4.18.1
- MongoDB v4.8.0

### Project Status <a name="status" />
Will update once finished

### Future Plans <a name="plans" />
Will update once finished.

### What I Have Learned <a name="learnings" />
This was a very educational experience which helped me familiarize myself with connecting a front-end and back-end. This was specifically helpful for learning 
how to use Express and getting comfortable with sending and handling HTTP requests, as well as converting data to and from JSON for use in a database and in the site
itself. Moreover, this gave me a basic overview of hosting a site and using an ssh to create a non-relational database on a server.

### Inspiration <a name="inspire" />
This project would not have been possible without the resources available on LinkedIn. In particular Shaun Wassel's "React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site".
The following <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/
share?account=56684793&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%
2Flearning%2Freact-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3D0CpniQAxSFKkfyP3IgG26A%253D%253D">link</a> 
will redirect you to it if you are interested in trying it for yourself. However, be warned that it is slightly out of date in certain areas. For example,
body-parser is included with modern React and will not need to be imported. You could refer to the code here to see how I worked around those issues.

### Thank You <a name="thanks" />
If you have gotten this far down the Readme, thank you for your interest! I am just beginning my coding journey and as such there are likely many things I did
inefficiently, or perhaps there are anti-patterns I used that I was unaware were not recommended, or my comment style could be better, etc. If so, please let me know 
a better way. My pride can take it.
